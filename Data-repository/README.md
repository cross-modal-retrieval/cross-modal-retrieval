# Data Repository
We gather commonly used baseline datasets for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

## Detailed Statistics for Cross-Modal Retrieval Datasets
Cross-modal retrieval datasets typically comprise multiple modalities with unique feature representations and semantic annotations. The data from different modalities are grouped or paired based on their semantic relevance or similarity. We compile commonly used datasets in various cross-modal retrieval tasks, and their statistics are as follows:
