# Code Repository
We collect as many cross-modal retrieval codes as possible, all of which are original source code written by the authors themselves.

The repository is divided into two main branches: **Text-image cross-modal retrieval** and **Cross-modal retrieval beyond text-image**.

## Text-image cross-modal retrieval
Current cross-modal retrieval methods are categorized into five overarching categories: unsupervised real-value retrieval, supervised real-value retrieval, unsupervised hashing retrieval, supervised hashing retrieval, and cross-modal retrieval under special scenarios. Each of these overarching categories is subdivided based on specific technical architectures or scenarios:

## Cross-modal retrieval beyond text-image
This project also offers a comprehensive review of cross-modal retrieval methods that involve modalities beyond text-image, including text-video, text-audio, image-audio, image3D, and more.
