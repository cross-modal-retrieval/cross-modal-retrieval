# Supported Repositories

This is a supporting repository for the website (github.hub), which includes toolkits, code libraries, and databases related to cross-modal retrieval.

**Toolkit:**  
We have developed a user-friendly toolkit for cross-modal retrieval, allowing users to quickly run representative cross-modal retrieval methods. It includes a master file for invoking various cross-modal retrieval methods, as well as adapted versions of the original cross-modal retrieval code.

**Code Library:**  
We have gathered as many cross-modal retrieval codes as possible, all of which are original source code written by the authors themselves.

**Database:**  
We have collected commonly used baseline datasets for cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as some versions that have been processed for easier use.
