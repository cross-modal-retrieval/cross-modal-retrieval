# Supported Repositories
This is a supporting repository for the website (https://cross-modal-retrieval.github.io/), which includes toolbox, code library, and data library.

## Toolbox
We have developed a user-friendly toolkit for cross-modal retrieval, allowing users to quickly run representative cross-modal retrieval methods. It includes a master file for invoking various cross-modal retrieval methods, as well as adapted versions of the original cross-modal retrieval code.

## Code Library
We have gathered as many cross-modal retrieval codes as possible, all of which are original source code written by the authors themselves.

## Data Library
We have collected commonly used baseline datasets for cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as some versions that have been processed for easier use.
