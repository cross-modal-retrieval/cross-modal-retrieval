# Supported Repositories
This is a supporting repository for the website (https://cross-modal-retrieval.github.io/), which includes toolbox, code library, and data library.

## [Toolbox](https://github.com/cross-modal-retrieval/cross-modal-retrieval/edit/main/)
We develop a user-friendly toolbox for cross-modal retrieval, allowing users to quickly run representative cross-modal retrieval methods. It includes a master file for invoking various cross-modal retrieval methods, as well as adapted versions of original cross-modal retrieval codes.

## [Code Library](https://your-toolkit-url.com)
We collect as many cross-modal retrieval codes as possible, all of which are original source code written by the authors themselves.

## [Data Library](https://your-toolkit-url.com)
We gather commonly used baseline datasets for cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as some versions that are processed for easier use.
